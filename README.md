# jammming
This is one of the final projects for Codecademy React Course. 
In this project, I build a React web application called Jammming. 
I use my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
